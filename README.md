# Introduction

This repository hosts the code and data for paper "Reconstructing the evolution history of networked complex systems. Junya Wang, Yi-Jiao Zhang, Cong Xu, Jiaze Li, Jiachen Sun, Jiarong Xie, Ling Feng, Tianshou Zhou, and Yanqing Hu".

The folder `code_machine_learning` contains code for our machine learning model to generate the reconstructed edge sequence of a given network.

The folder `code_link_prediction` contains code for link prediction task with and without the restored edge sequence.

The folder `network_data` contains 17 real-world networks we used in this paper. Each line of the network data represents "source target snapshot"

The folder `source_data` contains data for figures in the main text of our paper.
